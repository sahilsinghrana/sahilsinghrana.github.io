> In the quiet of night, her voice called out,
> <br />Across the distance, a plea I heard,
> <br />Wanting to say sorry, but fear held me back,
> <br />Scared to reopen wounds, to stir up hurt.

> My words had hurt her deeply, I knew,
> <br />Trying to apologize felt heavy with regret,
> <br />Fearful of causing more pain, I withdrew,
> <br />Caught in silence, tangled in a net.

> But her voice, calm and distant,
> <br />Echoed softly in the night,
> <br />She didnâ€™t forgive, nor did she relent,

> Yesterday, today, tomorrow, each night,
> <br />With myself I fight,
> <br />What wrong would i have said,
> <br />to make the moon disappear so quick and fast,
