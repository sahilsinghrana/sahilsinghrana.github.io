> In the quiet of night, I left the chase, <br /> Yet thoughts of you persist, they never leave.<br />No need for a tangible form to see,<br />In my mind's eye, you dance free.

> No material form can capture your grace,<br />In my thoughts, you're a vision, a tranquil face.<br />Your presence in the night, serene and bright,<br />In my imagination, a mesmerizing sight.

> Though I've ceased to chase, you still remain.<br />Your beauty lingers, <br />In my heart and mind, you shine so bright.

> But still, I ponder how to reach towards you,<br />Obstacles loom, fears make me shy.<br />The path seems daunting, the journey long,<br />Yet your gentle light keeps me strong.

> In the darkness, I seek your soothing embrace,<br />Hoping for guidance, courage, and grace.<br />Moon, I plead for your calming assurance,<br />That my efforts will meet with acceptance and endurance.

> Oh moon, guide me through shadows and light,<br />Illuminate my path through the darkest night.<br />Together we'll transcend, conquer the fears,<br />As I journey towards you, through smiles and tears.
