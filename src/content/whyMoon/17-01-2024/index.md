> After many years, I saw the moon today,
> <br />Its beauty stirred butterflies in my brain's play.
> <br />Excitement bubbled, yet I masked it all,
> <br />As if meeting the moon was no grand recall.

> The meeting was brief, a celestial surprise,
> <br />As the moon graced my office with her quiet presence.
> <br />I wanted to offer her wonders untold,
> <br />But time slipped away like sand through my hands.

> I didn't greet her, held back by my own design,
> <br />Intending to paint myself in hues of indifference,
> <br />To dissuade her from seeking my flawed embrace,
> <br />To shield her from the storm that rages within.

> <br />We shared a lemon tea cake under her soft glow,
> <br />I feared it was our only moment, our only dance.
> <br />I stumbled in words, unable to reflect her radiance,
> <br />Yet in my heart, a yearning stirred for her return.

> I feared her goodness, her radiance,
> <br />For I knew too well the depths of my love,
> <br />And how unworthy I felt in her presence,
> <br />To offer her the life she truly deserves.

> I could, perhaps, provide all she dreams,
> <br />Yet uncertainties lingered, whispered doubts,
> <br />Not wanting to bind her in uncertainties,
> <br />In ifs and buts that cloud my restless soul.

> For in my heart, I carry the weight of love,
> <br />An unspoken truth, a silent vow,
> <br />To cherish her from afar, in quiet reverence,
> <br />And release her to dance freely in her own starlit sky.
