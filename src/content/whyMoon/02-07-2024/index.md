> Fool me couldn't understand that how many chances she already gave.

> How I threw them, made them go in vain.

> I felt already of getting more self-obsessed,

> Moon pointed that out, telling me how vulnerable i get by not reciprocating.

> I agree completely, intrigued too by looking at how deeply she understands people.
