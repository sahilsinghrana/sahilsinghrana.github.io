> I got to meet the moon again, for a whole day,
> <br />Never dreamed such a meeting would come my way.
> <br />From dawn till dusk, we walked side by side,
> <br />In her gentle presence, my worries would hide.

> It felt like an old friend, not distant or strange,
> <br />A comfort and joy that time didn't change.
> <br />I pondered how to keep the moon amused,
> <br />Her laughter, a melody that left me bemused.

> Seeking ways to bring her joy and delight,
> <br />Trying to stay calm, with all of my might.
> <br />Then one night, the moon drew near,
> <br />I touched her softly, a moment so dear.

> Frozen in time, with emotions untold,
> <br />Moon, unaware, as our story unfolds.
> <br />I hide my longing, my years of desire,
> <br />Moon believes, I've started to admire.

> Embracing her glow, in the silent night,
> <br />Moon and I, entwined in our secret light.
> <br />For the moon, I'll keep chasing the stars,
> <br />As she silently watches, from afar.

> I spent the whole day with moon, felt like a minute,
> <br />Afraid it might be the last, my heart in it.
> <br />Self-doubt crept in, questioning why,
> <br />Moon's perfection matched my ideal sky.

> In a moment of doubt, she embraced me tight,
> <br />Tears welled up, hidden from her sight.
> <br />I escaped quickly, afraid to reveal,
> <br />The depth of my emotions, how I feel.

> Moon, oblivious, shines bright above,
> <br />As I cherish our moments, secreted in love.
> <br />She may never know the depth of my yearning,
> <br />Kept in these words, forever burning.
