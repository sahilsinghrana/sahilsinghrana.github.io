# Quickly Debug Network Requests from Developer Network Tools to Postman

## What is Postman

Postman is a powerful API testing and development tool that simplifies the process of working with APIs. It allows users to design, test, and debug APIs more efficiently.

## Steps

1. **Open Developer Tools**

   > Developer tools are built-in utilities provided by web browsers that enable developers to inspect, debug, and analyze web applications.

   - To access developer tools, you can usually right-click on a webpage and select "Inspect" or use keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Option+I (Mac).

2. **Copy as cURL**

   > A cURL request is a command-line tool and library used to transfer data with URL syntax.
   > [See how to download file using curL](https://sahilsinghrana.github.io/blog/snippets/download-using-curl)

   - In developer tools, Right click on the request
   - Go to `Copy`
   - Select `Copy as cURL(bash)`
   - This captures all the necessary parameters and headers required to replicate the request.

3. **Paste/Import**

   - Open Postman
   - In Postman, you can either directly paste the copied cURL command into a new request
     > OR
   - use the "Import" feature to upload a saved cURL command file. Postman will automatically parse the cURL command and populate the request parameters.

4. **Boom**
   - Once the request is pasted or imported into Postman, hit the "Send" button to execute the request. Postman will send the request to the specified endpoint and display the response, Debug and troubleshoot any issues more effectively than with browser developer tools.
